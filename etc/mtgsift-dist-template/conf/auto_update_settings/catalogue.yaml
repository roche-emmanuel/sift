# The Catalogue configuration defines a list of "queries".
#
# Two queries are given here:
# - for MTG FCI FDHSI suitable for auto update
# - for MSG SEVIRI suitable to load a certain fixed dataset
# (NOTE: currently only one query at a time is supported, i.e. only the first is
# active)
#
# Each query must define the *reader* to use, the *search_path* where to look
# for files, optional *constraints*, and a mandatory definition of the desired
# *products*.
#
# From the configration for the given *reader* the *filter_patterns* are taken
# and used to match files in the given *search_path*. The *constraints* are
# applied to reduce the result list (for example to see only files where
# *platform_shortname* is "MSG4"). The given constraint items correspond to the
# replacement fields of the *filter_patterns* (different *filter_patterns* may
# have arbitrarily different constraints).
#

# Very important constraint options are those for defining restrictions for the
# data time(s). For at most one datetime replacement field from the
# *filter_patterns* a constraint can be given (all but the first are ignored).
# This type of constraint is detected, when an according explicit 'type' is
# defined for them; two of these explicit constraint types are available (for
# now):
#
# * ``type: datetime``
#   a fixed filter based on the different parts of the data time can be defined,
#   e.g. data from all 1st days of each month in 2019 at 12:00
# * ``type: recent_datetime``
#   a range of time steps relative to the current time ("now") can be defined,
#   e.g. all data for the current hour and the two before
#
#
# Finally with filename based filtering defined it must be configured, which
# actual *products* should be loaded/generated from the actual selection.  Each
# channel (or dataset name as defined in the file) must be given with a
# (possibly empty) list of derived product names - if the list is empty, the
# original dataset name is taken as product name.
#
# Note, that the order of items in a query is free, but the order of the top
# level items is recommended as shown here.
