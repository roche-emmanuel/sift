         Aerosol detection, experimental color map, ADP.cmap.

    <!-- TOWRdocs Description
         This experimental  color map is a modification of the baseline. It is intended to depict
         3 operationally relevant paramenters: smoke, dust, and dust+smoke. It reduces the parameters
         and color combinations shown in the baseline color legend when ADP products are displayed.
         Aerosol is defined in the algorithm Product User Guidance as the presence of either dust or smoke.
         The baseline color map contains several combinations of aerosol, dust, and smoke (e.g.
         "Aerosol+smoke"), which appear redundant. Some pixel combinations are repeated, for example, to
         assign a single pixel color where the baseline colormap has two different pixels assigned for
         a category that can be combined, such as dust,  and aerosol plus dust.

         The aerosol detection product contains the fields Aerosol, Smoke, and Dust. The goes-r plugin
         ingests these fields as a bitset, in the order of Aerosol, Dust, and Smoke (0=none detected, 1
         = detected).  These are assigned the physicalElement of ADP, which is the styleRule parameter
         in the styleRules file for GOES-R Level 2 products where this colormap is referenced in this
         repository. The dataMapping entries in the style rule file refer to the pixels in this colormap.

    <!-- TOWRdocs Status
         New experimental color map, modified from the baseline ADP color map. This colormap file has the
         same name as the baseline aerosol detection colormap, ADP.cmap.
